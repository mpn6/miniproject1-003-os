# Section 2 GitFlow and Git Commands

GitFlow
========

Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  

Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.

Git Terminology
============

* Repository -  contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
